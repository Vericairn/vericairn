# CLI reference additions

The 0.8.4 development build adds `prompt list`, `show`, `add`, `revise`, `retire`,
`favor`, `hide`, `disable`, `copy` and `use`. See [Saved prompts](prompts.md) for
category discovery, reversible preferences and recorded uses with new work.

`work brief <key> --agent-context` selects the same measured brief as the MCP
`work_brief` tool and brief resource: mandatory originals remain complete, and
named optional originals are withheld without a byte allocation.
`--max-bytes <positive-integer>` implies `--agent-context` and admits optional
originals only when they fit; required overflow refuses. These options preserve
recipient and assignment presentation settings. Without either option, the
ordinary complete selected-scope brief is unchanged. See [MCP resources](mcp.md#resources-084-development)
for exact representations and hashes.

Revision 4, October 23, 2026. Point to the operator's guide for 0.8.3's command additions.

Revision 3, October 20, 2026. Add package registry observations and account-holder intents, and document exact-byte document pinning and policy definition hashing in the development build.

The build generates the complete CLI reference from its command tree, including every option. Published references under `docs/releases/` describe their frozen builds. This page documents commands added after 0.8.0 for 0.8.2. The [operator's guide](operator-guide.md) describes 0.8.3's additions: `work new`, `release withdraw`, `work move-plan`, `release submit --check`, `estate init --release` and `estate upgrade --from`.

## `vericairn operator close`

The 0.8.4 development build replaces per-release closing scripts with an operator command.
Without options it lists exactly the latest completed, reviewed and unaccepted results with their
exit questions, result summaries, passing-review summaries and independence, and exact hashes.

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--select <key>` | Select a work-order key; repeat for several steps. |
| `--all` | Select the entire displayed eligible list; cannot be combined with `--select`. |
| `--by <operator-id>` | Required with a selection. The operator's own admitted device signs every acceptance. |
| `--from <file>` | Use a saved `operator close --json` listing with a selection; `-` reads standard input. |
| `--json` | Print one typed response. Selected evidence is shown on standard error before signing. |
| `--estate <root>`, `-e <root>` | Select the estate. |

Each acceptance names its exact result and all displayed passing reviews. A changed selected
work order, result or review, a missing passing review, an existing acceptance or a non-operator
refuses the whole action without acceptances. `--all` also pins complete eligible membership.
Current signing custody checks presence per acceptance when required. Exit 0 means success,
1 a selection or record refusal, and 2 invalid arguments or a client failure. The
[operator actions guide](operator-actions.md#close-finished-steps-in-one-action) describes saved
listings, API/SDK counterparts and recovery after interrupted storage.

## `vericairn decisions new`

The 0.8.4 development build records a supplied operator answer with its exact design document pins. See the [operator workflow](operator-guide.md#record-an-answered-ask-with-its-design-changes).

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--by <id>` | Required recorder principal. The ask supplies the deciding operator. |
| `--ask <id>` | Required ask revision id; its current state must still wait for this operator's supplied answer. |
| `--statement <text>` | Required verbatim operator words, including whitespace. |
| `--answered-at <timestamp>` | Required UTC answer time, with second precision. |
| `--base <commit>` | Required full local commit before the design changes. |
| `--title <text>`, `--summary <text>`, `--synthesis <text>` | Required decision prose. |
| `--effect <text>` | Repeat for each effect; at least one is required. |
| `--document <path>` | Repeat for every design file changed from the base through the working tree; omit for an empty set. |
| `--stake <value>` | `low` (default), `medium`, `high` or `critical`. |
| `--affects <id>` | Repeat for affected work orders. |
| `--not-authorized <text>` | Repeat for exclusions. |
| `--decided-at <timestamp>` | Defaults to the answer time. A later time is refused. |
| `--expected-ask <hash>` | Optional expected hash of the current ask revision. |
| `--json` | Complete `DecisionNewResponse`, on success or refusal. |

The API is `POST /v1/decisions/new`. Its `DecisionNewRequest` has required fields `by`, `ask`, `statement`, `answeredAt`, `baseCommit`, `title`, `summary`, `synthesis`, `effects` and `documents`; optional fields are `stake`, `affects`, `notAuthorized`, `decidedAt` and `expectedAsk`. An empty document list is explicit in JSON. SDK operations are `DecisionFromAsk` and `DecisionFromAskAsync`, with the same request.

The response has `written` (decision receipt or null), `pins` (stored document-revision receipts), `problem` and `ok`. HTTP 422 means validation refused with no records stored; HTTP 200 carries success or a partly stored batch. Always inspect `ok` and `problem`. A `reconcile-required` problem preserves the receipts actually stored and requires inspection before retrying. Cancellation after dispatch can also leave an unknown outcome; read the ask and original receipts before sending another write. CLI exit 0 means the complete batch was stored; exit 2 reports a refusal or incomplete batch. The command does not commit, push, publish or change document text.

## `vericairn docs pin`

Record a document's next revision from the exact bytes in the estate repository:

```sh
vericairn docs pin docs/guide.md --by <principal id> --summary "Describe the revised workflow."
vericairn docs pin docs/guide.md --by <principal id> --summary "Update the examples." --expected <current pin id> --json
```

| Argument or option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `<path>` | Required. A normalized repository-relative file path under `design/` or `docs/`, using forward slashes. |
| `--by <id>` | Required. The authoring principal; the runtime uses its admitted device under the estate's signing rules. |
| `--summary <text>` | Required. What this revision is or changes. |
| `--title <text>` | Override the title. Otherwise carry the current pin's title; a first pin uses the file name without its extension. |
| `--expected <id>` | Require this exact record id to be the current pin for the path. An old, unrelated or unknown id refuses the write. |
| `--render-template` | Default false. Refresh only an existing instance's declared generated regions and pin the resulting bytes in one recoverable batch. Also admits root `README.md` in format 3. |
| `--json` | Print the record receipt as `{"path":"records/document-revision/...","id":"...","hash":"sha256:..."}`. The hash identifies the record; its body holds the document's byte hash. |
| `--estate <root>`, `-e <root>` | Select the estate; the runtime reads the file in that estate's repository. |
| `--help`, `-h`, `-?`, `/?`, `/h` | Show command help. |

The first pin is revision 1. Each later pin increments the current revision and supersedes that record. The runtime computes SHA-256 and byte count from one byte read, preserving line endings and any byte-order mark. Media type follows the file extension: Markdown, plain text, JSON, YAML, HTML, XML, CSV, PDF, SVG, PNG and JPEG are recognized; other extensions use `application/octet-stream`.

By default, unchanged bytes refuse even if the title or summary differs. Paths outside the document directories, unavailable files, symbolic links, case aliases, whole generated documents and generated register members refuse. Authored documents may contain generated regions. A stale expected id or multiple current pins also refuses. These refusals record nothing. Without `--expected`, the runtime selects the current pin when the operation begins; clients that read a pin earlier should supply its id.

If two branches pin the same predecessor, their merged records form a fork. Both `estate check` and `docs pin` identify the conflicting pins and predecessor. Record a `reconciliation` that keeps one successor and withdraws the others, settle the document text, then pin the combined bytes with the kept id as `--expected`. Neither branch wins automatically, and all revision records remain.

Text output prints the document revision, record id and record hash. Exit 0 means the pin was recorded; a refusal exits 2 with a diagnostic or validation findings. A receipt accompanied by a companion-recovery problem also exits 2: reconcile the stored operation before retrying. Without `--render-template`, the command does not edit the document or its hand-written revision line. The explicit option preserves authored text and refreshes only generated payloads, including the new revision's metadata. See [Living documents](operator-guide.md#16-living-documents) and [template adoption](templates.md#adopt-an-existing-estate-document).

The matching API is `POST /v1/documents/pin`, with JSON fields `path`, `by`, `summary`, optional `title`, optional `expected` and optional `renderTemplate` (default false). It returns `DocumentPinResponse`: `written` (the record receipt), `revision`, `problem` and `ok`. A refusal returns HTTP 422 with no `written` or `revision`; a stored receipt returns HTTP 200, including when a companion problem needs reconciliation. SDK clients use `DocumentPin(DocumentPinRequest)` or `DocumentPinAsync(DocumentPinRequest, CancellationToken)`:

```csharp
var result = await client.DocumentPinAsync(
    new DocumentPinRequest("docs/guide.md", principal, "Update the examples.", Expected: currentPinId),
    cancellationToken);
```

The runtime reads its estate file for every client. Callers supply neither document bytes nor a claimed hash or revision number.

## `vericairn policies hash`

Print the definition hash of a prepared policy or recurring-duty body:

```sh
vericairn policies hash --body policy.json
vericairn policies hash --body duty.json --json
```

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--body <file>` | Required. Read the prepared JSON body from this file. Use `-` to read standard input. Supply the body without a record envelope. |
| `--json` | Return `{"definitionHash":"sha256:...","problem":null}`. Without this option, print only the hash and a newline. |
| `--help`, `-h`, `-?`, `/?`, `/h` | Show command help. |
| `--estate <root>`, `-e <root>` | Inherited root option; hashing does not use it or open an estate. |
| `--recipient <id>` | Inherited presentation option; hashing does not use it. |
| `--for-assignment <id>` | Inherited presentation option; hashing does not use it. |
| `--depth <depth>` | Inherited presentation option; hashing always prints the same hash or JSON response. |

The value is SHA-256 over the record format's RFC 8785 canonical body, with only the top-level `basis` member omitted. This is the `definitionHash` an operator approves and `policies declare` checks. `basis` may be absent while preparing approval; adding or changing it leaves the hash unchanged. Every other member contributes, including a nested member named `basis`.

The command reads only its input and writes no files, records, keys or live state. It needs neither an estate nor write authority. Exit 0 means a hash was printed. An unreadable file, invalid JSON, a value that cannot be canonicalized, or a value without the policy body structure exits 2 with a diagnostic and no hash.

Hashing checks the body structure and canonical JSON representation. Declaration still validates references, rule parameters, approval and authority. See the [adoption guide](policy-adoption.md) for using the value in an exact approval, and [Estate policies](policies.md) for the API and SDK equivalents.

## `vericairn packages`

Observe nuget.org's public state, or record an intent for its account holder. These commands require
a valid estate at record format 3, a product's `packages` declaration and a recorded release version.
The [operator procedure](operator-actions.md#package-publication-unlisting-and-deprecation) gives the declaration and the order of actions.

```sh
vericairn packages observe --product <product-id> --version 1.0.0 --by <principal-id>
vericairn packages unlist --product <product-id> --version 1.0.0 --package Example.Widget --by <operator-id>
vericairn packages deprecate --product <product-id> --version 1.0.0 --package Example.Widget --by <operator-id> --reason Legacy --message "Use the replacement package." --alternate-package Example.Replacement --alternate-range "[2.0.0,)"
vericairn packages observe --operation <original-intent-id> --by <operator-id> --json
```

| Command and option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `observe --product <id> --version <version>` | Observe every package in the current product declaration for this recorded release version. Both options are required together. |
| `observe --operation <id>` | Observe the package and original release pins of an unlisting or deprecation intent. Use instead of `--product` and `--version`; any revision identifies the original intent. |
| `observe --by <id>` | Required observing principal. Recording an intent's outcome requires the estate operator. |
| `unlist`, `deprecate`: `--product <id> --version <version> --package <id> --by <id>` | All required. Record one package version's intent as the estate operator and print the nuget.org step. These commands perform no registry write and make no registry request. |
| `deprecate --reason <reason>` | Required. `Legacy`, `CriticalBugs` or `Other`; repeat the option or supply multiple values. |
| `deprecate --message <text>` | Optional exact message, at most 500 characters. Omitted means no message. |
| `deprecate --alternate-package <id>` | Optional replacement package. Omitted means no replacement. |
| `deprecate --alternate-range <range>` | Optional replacement version range, at most 256 characters. Requires `--alternate-package`. |
| `--json` | Return the complete `PackagesResponse`, including original `intent`, latest `operation`, manual `instruction`, observations and any problem. |
| `--estate <root>`, `-e <root>` | Select the estate in which to record the observations or intent. |
| `--recipient <id>`, `--for-assignment <id>`, `--depth <depth>` | Inherited presentation options. Package responses keep their complete evidence and fixed factual text. |
| `--help`, `-h`, `-?`, `/?`, `/h` | Show help. |

Text output names each written record, id and hash, then each package's publication, listing and
deprecation states. JSON exposes `packages[].state.evidence[]` as exact URL, response-body SHA-256,
HTTP status, byte count and content encoding, beside the observation record. Hashes cover the received
body bytes before gzip decoding. Deprecation details retain NuGet's reasons,
message and alternate id/range when present. A missing version is `not-found` with `unknown` listing
and deprecation. That successful observation exits 0. Refusal or an unconfirmed intended outcome
exits 2. Failed network reads create no observation; an existing intent remains available to resume.

An identical intent command returns its original identity, including after restarting the runtime.
Changing the intended deprecation metadata under that identity is refused. Observe the original
operation after performing the printed account-holder step. A matching outcome becomes
`observed-success`; a completed read that does not match remains `uncertain`. No dispatch timestamp
is invented for an account-holder act. Re-observation can report a later change without rewriting a
historical success.

| API operation | SDK method and cancellable counterpart |
|---|---|
| `POST /v1/packages/observe` with `PackagesObserveRequest` | `PackagesObserve`, `PackagesObserveAsync` |
| `POST /v1/packages/unlist` with `PackagesUnlistRequest` | `PackagesUnlist`, `PackagesUnlistAsync` |
| `POST /v1/packages/deprecate` with `PackagesDeprecateRequest` | `PackagesDeprecate`, `PackagesDeprecateAsync` |

All return `PackagesResponse`; the API binds `by` to the authenticated acting device like the other
record-writing operations. `GET /v1/providers` and `release providers` list the `nuget-org` package
registry provider and its limits. There is no API-key option or registry mutation method.

## Template documents in 0.8.4 development

`vericairn templates list` lists available exact versions; `templates show <id>`
prints their contracts and accepts `--version`. Create an instance with:

```sh
vericairn docs new example/design docs/design.md --version 1.0.0 --by <owner> --title "Design"
vericairn docs sections docs/design.md --json
vericairn docs brief docs/design.md --section overview --max-bytes 60000 --json
vericairn docs review docs/design.md --section overview --fidelity draft --by <reviewer> --outcome current --summary "Read the exact section and sources."
```

Creation also accepts `--configuration <file>` containing `options`, `scope` and
`overrides`, and `--level remind|warn|refuse` (default `warn`). It refuses an
existing file. Section reads and briefs accept `--commit` for an exact external
repository source. Section review requires `--section` and `--fidelity` together;
`--judgments <file>` supplies evaluator verdicts and exact evidence for that
section. All commands retain the root connection options and `--json` behavior.
A brief exceeding `--max-bytes` exits 2 with explicit incomplete evidence and no
silent truncation. Creation interrupted after declaration storage also exits 2
and preserves its receipt for reconciliation. See [Templates](templates.md) for
the contract, defaults, overrides, review rules and recovery.

For an existing file, `docs adopt <template> <path> --version <version> --by
<owner> --expected-content <file hash>` preserves authored bytes and history.
An existing living declaration also requires `--expected-declaration <record
hash>`. Optional `--configuration`, `--title` and `--level` supply the same
choices; existing duties remain unchanged. `--preview` returns the unsigned
proposal as JSON. `--with-regions` explicitly includes generated ownership and
requires prepared markers and any existing migration review. After adoption,
`docs pin --render-template` refreshes those regions. See the complete
[adoption workflow](templates.md#adopt-an-existing-estate-document) before
transferring a hand-maintained table to records.
